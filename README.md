Code that accompanies my lecture *Rust for the Impatient*, which is a one-hour tour of the Rust programming language.
In the actual lecture I do live-coding in a single Rust project named `minicrp`. These steps were created for planning.

If you want to seriously get started with Rust, I recommend going through the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) for a comprehensive introduction, or starting with [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) for a more example-oriented and hands-on introduction to Rust.
